-n: Display vertex normals.
-N: Dlsplay surface normals.
-I: Set the number iso-lines specefied in UxVxW.
-F: Set the polygon fineness.
-f: Set the polyline fineness.
-L: Set the normals' length.
-c: curve colours.
-C: polygon colours.
    Override? a value of 0 or 1 telling I2P whether to override colours with the new colour, or just set it when the curves have no speccfied colour.
-W: the wire setup of FreeForms 
    IritGrapGlblState.DrawSurfaceWire = Settings.SurfaceWireSetup & 0x01;
    IritGrapGlblState.DrawSurfaceBndry = Settings.SurfaceWireSetup & 0x02;
    IritGrapGlblState.DrawSurfaceSilh = Settings.SurfaceWireSetup & 0x04;
    IritGrapGlblState.DrawSurfaceSketch = Settings.SurfaceWireSetup & 0x08;
    IritGrapGlblState.DrawSurfaceRflctLns = Settings.SurfaceWireSetup & 0x10;
    IritGrapGlblState.DrawSurfaceKnotLns = Settings.SurfaceWireSetup & 0x20;
-S: The light's position and optionally its ambient, diffuse, and specular intenseties.
-p: Point size.
-M: Draw the control mesh of freeforms.
-V: Draw models monolothic.
-P: Draw surface polygons.
-t: Draw surface orient.
-o: Flip normal orient.
-w: Draw wireframe (must have -P too).
-z: The Z offset of curves.
-Z: The ZMin and ZMax clipping planes.
ModelFile: Can be a relative or absolute path (surrounded by quotes if it contains spaces).
           Relative paths are meant to be used when the presentation is saved and is associated with a path on the filesystem.

For example:
"-P teapot.itd": Import teapot.itd from the presentation's path and render polygons.
"-M -P -w 1 C:/bone.itd": Import bone.itd from the given absolute path and render its control mesh and wireframe.
"-S 1,2,3,0.1,1,1 -Z -10 10 fltrtest.itd": Import flttrtest.itd, set the light position to (1,2,3) with
					   ambient=0.1, diffuse=1, specular = 1, set ZMin to -10 and ZMax to 10
