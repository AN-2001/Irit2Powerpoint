-n: Display vertex normals.
-N: Dlsplay surface normals.
-I: Set the number iso-lines specefied in UxVxW.
-F: Set the polygon fineness.
;f: Set the polyline fineness.
-L: Set the normals' length.
-c: curve colours.
-C: polygon colours.
    Override? a value of 0 or 1 telling I2P whether to override colours with the new colour, or just set it when the curves have no speccfied colour.
-W: the wire setup of FreeForms
